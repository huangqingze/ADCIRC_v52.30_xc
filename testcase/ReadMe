files with NWS7 tag are used for testing wind stress provided on a rectangular grid.
files with NWS6 tag are the equivalent wind speed input for comparison.

On Hatteras for some reasons, the parrallel adcirc works well only if I compile the source codes with 
mvapich2/2.3b_intel-18.0.0_nemisis_ofed-4.1

otherwise I would get mpi errors (with openmpi) or code compilation errors (with mvapich2/2.3b_intel-18.0.0_ch3_ofed-4.1).
